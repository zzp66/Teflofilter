This makes them a versatile and cost-effective choice for many applications.<\/p>"}},"text_7VinKd":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"What industries and applications are these filter bags best suited for?","answer":"<p>Nylon mesh bags excel in liquid filtration across diverse industries.  Common applications include: water treatment (municipal, wastewater, industrial), chemical processing (filtering acids, alkalis, solvents), food & beverage production (clarification, ingredient processing), pharmaceuticals, paints and coatings, metalworking fluids, and more.  Essentially, any process requiring the removal of particulate matter from a liquid stream can benefit from nylon mesh filtration.<\/p>"}},"text_AQQHWG":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"What micron ratings and mesh sizes are available for your nylon filter bags?","answer":"<p>We offer a comprehensive range of micron ratings from 10 to 500 microns, corresponding to mesh sizes from 10 to 500.
